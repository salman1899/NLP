0,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.,1
1,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range.",1
2,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously.

54,"I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè",0

It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion.",1
80,"Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance.",1
81,"Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE.",0

This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL.",0
84,One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.,0

87,The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.,1

The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it.",1

Finger print scanner is not there.Mainly IR blaster is missing which was really usefull feature of MI phones earlier.We need to add screeguard ourselves.

111,"My honest review after using for a week:This smartphone is the best product in budget segment. Nothing can replace this mobile in this budget (6799) with such a quality.Now we see  pros and cons with performance.PROS:‚óæDisplay - 6.53"" 720 x 1440 pixel is really appreciated in this budget. Even redmi 8a has lesser screen size than this.‚óæ Battery - 5000mah. Definitely stands for 2 days of normal usage like Facebook, instagram, WhatsApp and web surf. But definitely stands for atleast 1 day in intensive usage.‚óæ Camera - Even though it has a single rear camera, with 13mp, it manages to give decent pictures and it captures portrait very well( you can see my pictures) Very good optimization with single camera, really appreciable. And lot of features in additional settings which adds some fun. Selfie camera gives decent pic with 5mp. Cannot expect pro quality with this budget.‚óæ Video quality is really good and upto the mark with 60fps which is usually not available in budget segment phones.‚óæ No lagging, runs smoothly, no annoying adds still now, and we can uninstall most of the preinstalled apps. So no issues with the apps.‚óæSpeaker is quite decent and sufficient to fill the room. Can not be expected much. It does it's work that's all.‚óæ Charging - 10W charger is given and it solidly takes 2.5 hrs to get 100% charged. It is quite good.‚óæ Price - no smartphone with this specs has such low price with good quality.CONS:üîªIt is provided with micro usb port. But in this Price segment we can't expect for c port in today's market.üîªNo magnetic sensor. But it will be a problem only for frequent travellers to new places if they need navigation directions in maps. But for routine life, it is not that much important.üîªIt takes a lot time for initial booting setup. But after that, it runs smoothly.üîªEven though it is claimed as a gaming processor Helio G25, it is not suitable for intensive heavy games. Only we can play a small games which don't require more graphics.Conclusion:‚úîÔ∏èAt this price segment, those who want a smartphone for normal daily routine works like calling, chatting, online classes video calls, using social media, playing small games, taking decent pictures..you can definitely buy this product. This product is suitable for you and fulfills your day. I suggest you to buy this. You will be satisfied for sure.‚ùå Heavy gamer who needs a beast processors and pro photographer who needs a powerful camera.. this product is not for you.üî∑ Finally, in this price segment, this product does a very good performance. It is worth buying. Worth for every paise you spend on this.Thanks Amazon.",0

You will be frustrated after using it for sometime. There are loads of problems with the UI (user interface), some apps dont open, and the phone will suddenly hang, which will require a restart.

135,"I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money.",0

142,I bought this for my mother as she won't use heavily I found this is the perfect for her within this price friend but after six months I am able to see a lots and lots of legging and it became very slow camera quality is not at all good RAM is very slow picture quality is bad battery backup is good screen resolution should be little more brighter size of the phone is good the phone heats up while charging and not for heavy duty uses,0
143,"I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram.",0
144,"Poor Quality, the major feature of screen itself is not working properly. The behaviour of screen on and off is not appropriately, its Automatically ON and OFF simultaneously. Open application, this phone open applications at the same time while click on single app means click anywhere automatically, phone not hanged but running itself without any input.",0
145,"The phone look wise looks stylish no doubt but it suffers from two major drawbacks. One , the FM is not operational without headphones attached. Second , there is no indicator that keeps blinking when a notification comes till such time the user attends to the phn. This same indicator also teels u if your phone is getting charged or not",0
146,"camera quality quite poorer at this price segment. miui 12 software is one of the rubbish ui i have ever seen. battery is little bit good but charging time is too long, that is frustrating. fingerprint reader is good but not much faster. I recommend to buyer try something other products in this price.",0
147,"The operation is very slow, even opening dial pad takes a couple of seconds. To get a clear picture, I have an android phone which I had purchased in 2012 that has only 512 MB of RAM, fortunately is operating even today. It handles the tasks far better and faster than Redmi 9A which apparently has 2 GB of RAM",0
148,"Everything is awesome about this phone.  Believe me t this price there is no better phone in the market as on date.  Everything regarding camera, battery, ease of use all are good if solely price is considered.  Don't compare with high end phones.  This is too good, in fact awesome for the price.",1
149,"In less than 10 days of delivery the phone has started bending on charging. Been trying to contact Amazon and seller for two weeks now with no response. All this when it is clearly stated on purchase page that it has a 10 day replacement and 1 year warranty and I have been an Amazon prime customer since start. This marks it as the last prime subscription. Had a similar issue with a previous phones and the so called ""customer service executives"" called me a dozen of times asking to explain the problem only to disappear till the next one called and annoyed me to the extent to give up. Go buy it in a store with precautions instead online from these cheats.",0
150,Worst phone ever seen in my life. I had Redmi 7A based on which I purchased this phone. So complicated that you cannot find your basic required settings option easily. You need to break your head to find it . Waste of money. Also the mobile is hanging too many times and is very slow. Pls don't go for this mobile.,0
151,The battery drains very quickly after few months of use without playing any games or doing anything significant. The theme forces every app on screen which is inconvenient. The screen does not switch off when held over eat which can cause missing or disconnection with accidental touch. Overall I won't recommend.,0
152,"I have been using this phone close to a year. The phone has all the problems that can be found on a low budget phone. Slow, lagging, unresponsive touch, huge charging time (approx: 3 hours), crappy camera, low speaker quality, dull display etc etc. Call quality is average. Battery life is initially 2 days but then gradually it lessens. Actually it is so slow and so dull that you will not feel like using it for anything else  other than calling, talking and whtsapp messaging. But yes, if you at all have to use it for other functions then u wont be disappointed as long as u use light apps like ola, upi app, trading apps etc. But please remain prepared to face occasional lags in those also. All in all it is just an average phone which demands a bit of patience from the user while operating. And yes it will not make u a smartphone addict. üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ",0
153,Awesome product at the price point of view.But during adding the review why it was asking for giving ratings for fingerprint reader as this product doesn't has a fingerprint reader so because of that for that only I have given 1 star and for camera given 3 star as it is average and for battery life given all 5 star due to good battery life and for overview again given all 5 starts as it's a very good product at the price point of view.,1
154,"Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice...",1
155,The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!,1

159,"The product is not at all what I expected(turned out to be superior to my thoughts) to be, apart from the body material (which is simply awesome) of the phone, everything's moderate but the organ which captivated me the most is its 5000 Mah Monster Battery which comes equipped within this mind blowing price range.Although it would have been great if redmi would have provided a fingerprint reader embedded with this device but again hey you gotta make the sale lucrative right..Lastly, In this special occasion of patriot week I salute the team of Xiaomi for formulating and marketing these sorts of Budget products across India for users like us could leverage it up to the brim for our daily ordinary needs..Thank You",1

181,"When it comes to any smartphone the important thing is it's charger, if we don't have that ,we are unable to do our daily works. Firstly the adapter as well cable not good, when I received my delivery, I unboxed it and after completeling phone settings, I put it on charging, after few minutes I saw the smartphone is not charging at all, then I brought another adapter as well as it's cable worth 350Rs , then it starts to charge. When we trust upon you guys and order it from you then why we have to go to the to waste extra money. Compare to first item this is better , I currently have the replaced one. First one after using sometime when kept it for charging the phone is not at all switching on. Overall the bad experience with Amazon. Waste of money.

The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later",1

185,"Dear All,Got the new 9A today. Build quality is excellent. Everything is fine except for the performance of the device! Although not disappointed completely but tweaking through the Developer Mode had given some satisfaction ( 0x - Animation ) ! Probably the Latest MIUI and the Android 10 is not being handled properly / managed by the 3Gb RAM and 32 GB storage ! That maybe the only issue. It is lagging partially even through navigation / opening an app etc.Regards",1

Camera is good for whatsapp/fb clicks. Initially I felt the phone is quite lagging but later it worked fine.,0

191,In just one month it stopped working. When taken to service centre they are saying that there is water inside. But it has never been in water.. If a few drops of water can spoil the phone then why the hell should I pay for it.

203,The phone stopped working after 20 days . It is stuck in a boot loop. MI refused to give a replacement as 10 days was the cutoff date for replacement and the service center says the main board has to be replaced . If the main board can fail after 20 days what else will go wrong in the long run. My advice is to not buy this phone,0

Not able to switch on gain. Amazon return date ended by 2 days by the time they sent it back to me. And now I'm running around for it's repair.

257,I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.,0

304,Really bad phone on both response to touch as well as the connectivity which is the basic functionality of a phone. The calls drop whenever I'm on call and very often I don't receive calls as it says the network is not reachable. I thought it was a network issue in the beginning but now after using the same sim card on a different phone  can see it is the fault of the phone itself.,0

350,First impression :I thought it would be hanging but after turning off background sync and uninstalled unwanted apps it‚Äôs smooth to operate.

354,1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.,0
355,Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment,0
356,This redmi 9A phone is awesome valued for money. It has good performance.  Good battery life using this for 8 month must buy .but you got to use it in good way by optimising it correctly so ur notification bar won't lag or slow down otherwise good phone.,1
357,"Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range",1
358,Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile,0

440,this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even.
